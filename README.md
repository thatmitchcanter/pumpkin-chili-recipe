# Pumpkin Chili

This chili recipe, while some may claim is technically _not_ chili, is one that I've worked on for the past few years.  What started as a random online recipe has turned into a staple for my family and I during the fall / winter months.

## Ingredients
  - ~15oz of Pumpkin Puree (either harvested from a pumpkin or 1 Can's worth)
  - 1 Can of Manwich
  - ~14.5 oz Fire Roasted Tomatoes (fresh or canned), diced
  - 1 - 1.5lb Hamburger Meat
  - Spices to taste (pumpkin pie spice, pepper, salt, and others as desired)
  - 1 Box Pasta (or servings of fresh pasta).
  - Cheese, shredded (Pepper Jack, Colby Jack, or Mexican Blend works best)

## Preperation

1. Brown the hamburger meat to medium-well. Don't overcook it, as it will continue cooking in the slow cooker. Season with salt/pepper to taste.  I like to add in a splash of Worcestershire sauce to give it a bit of a savory kick.
2. Combine the browned meat, pumpkin, manwich, and tomatoes in a slow-cooker. Season with pumpkin pie spice, salt, and pepper to taste.  Feel free to add other spices to change the flavor profile [I add juniper berries to mine to give it a slight fruity flavor].
3. Cook for 2 hours on low, then simmer on warm.
4. Prepare the pasta. Either use a box and prepare as listed, or serve up your favorite fresh pasta.
5. Put the chili on top of the pasta, and garnish liberally with cheese.
6. Enjoy!
